Applied inheritance and polymorphism to model complex instruments

4. Memory Management and Performance Optimization
Managed dynamic memory allocation for high-frequency trading systems
Optimized performance using pointers, smart pointers, and RAII patterns

Implemented numerical methods for pricing derivatives (e.g., Newton-Raphson, finite differences)
Solved optimization problems using gradient-based techniques

6. Monte Carlo Simulation for Option Pricing
Built a Monte Carlo simulation engine for European and Asian options

7. Binomial Trees for Option Pricing
Constructed binomial tree models for pricing American and European options
Efficiently handled recombining and non-recombining trees

8. Finite Difference Methods for PDEs in Finance
Applied finite difference schemes (explicit, implicit) to solve Black-Scholes PDE
Focused on stability and convergence in option pricing

9. Advanced Options Pricing Models
Developed models for exotic options (barrier, lookback, Asian)
Implemented the Heston model and SABR volatility models

10. Fixed Income and Bond Pricing
Coded yield curve construction algorithms (bootstrapping)
Priced bonds using duration, convexity, and discount factor calculations

11. Interest Rate Models

Developed stress testing simulations for financial portfolios

14. Algorithmic Trading Systems
Developed backtesting engine for algorithmic trading strategies
Optimized order execution using limit order book simulations

15. Multithreading and Parallel Programming
